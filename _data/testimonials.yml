  comment: I've known Lovell for years. In college, I would almost always find him nose-deep in a laptop reading techie blogs, studying, or coding. When it was studying, Lovell always had a positive outlook; he loves to learn. During my tenure as Student Government Vice President, Lovell brought his UX skills to the table and created my campaign media in two consecutive successful runs. Being creative as well as intelligent, he did an excellent design job with flyers, logos, and social media.
           There was certainly a blue-screen moment in my laptop's life, and it was Lovell to the rescue.
           I cannot imagine working with a technical person that has a better attitude and social skills

  comment: When I hear the name Lovell Felix the terms hard work, determination, brilliant, success story, friend, entrepreneur, and computer wizard comes to mind among many other desirable attributes that he possesses.
           I had the pleasure of attending several classes at Midwestern State University with Lovell and working on various team projects together. I recall our countless nights of studying into the wee hours of the morning, putting the final touches on presentations, working together on various community service projects, and serving as Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer of the Caribbean Student Organization (CSO) at Midwestern State University. Lovell always went the extra mile to get the project done and mediocrity was never good enough. He always wanted to be the best and pushed and encouraged those who worked alongside him to ascend to a higher standard.
           What amazed me was Lovell's insatiable hunger for knowledge, especially computer knowledge. I recall many hours of Lovell undertaking new projects that were beyond the scope of our curriculum but sparked his interest. While many searched the internet for entertainment Lovell searched for "How To" videos and articles that could help him gain the knowledge he desired. Many students would have been satisfied with just his grades but Lovell never seemed satisfied and continuously pushed for more. Evidence of this hard work can be seen in a few items I use everyday, as I now have and use on a daily basis Google and Android apps that Lovell has created.
           Lovell's professionalism and desire to succeed make him an asset to any company he becomes a part of. It is my hope to have the pleasure of working alongside Lovell in the future as I know the sky is the limit for an individual with his talents and commitment to success.
           Keep up the great work Lovell!

  comment: Mr. Felix is a very unique and exceptional character as the student and as a professional. Mr. Felix is blessed with the positive attitude due to which he has always excelled in academic activity and otherwise. He is highly disciplined, sincere and has pleasing manners. From my working and studying experience with Mr. Felix, I can attest to the fact that he has the capability to complete assigned tasks with minimum guidance that makes him intellectually independent.
           He is good both in oral and written communication. He has the capability to put across ideas very clearly both orally and in written form.
           In project we have worked on together, Mr. Felix has always emerged as a team leader because of his sincerity and overall multifaceted personality.
           Another great characteristic of Mr. Felix is his creativity which has always made him outshine other with similar skills. Because of his creativity I have entrusted him with a number of personal projects over the years all of which he has exceed my expectations.
           I strongly recommend Mr. Felix for any position as I know he can achieve great things.

  comment: Lovell Felix designed Spice Jamz Radio website, and he is currently responsible for the ongoing development of the website. He also perform day to day site maintenance, and monitors the web server and website ensuring optimal performance. Lovell truly is a hard worker, and displayed his dedication on numerous occasions at Spice Jamz Radio, and he must be commended.  He has a wealth of knowledge in Web Development, and competent in MySQL and SQL database syntax, and worked heavily in LAMP web development environment. Equally important,  Lovell was selected by Google to be part of their Chrome OS Notebook Pilot program. As a member on the developer channel, he focused mainly on finding bugs/errors related to web pages rendered by the operating system. That said,  he worked with cutting edge technology that is expected to dominate the operating system market in the future, so his experience with Chrome OS, and ability to locate bugs/errors has been an asset to Spice Jamz Radio. He has illustrated the ability to build a functioning website, debug for errors, maintain web hosting account, protect website from hacks, and routinely created backups. Nevertheless, the work ethics he has displayed has secured his position as Spice Jamz Webmaster, and we look forward to build Spice Jamz with him on our team.
